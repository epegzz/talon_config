# My Talon config

This is my own custom Talon config. Currently only used to support eye tracking 
mouse control via keyboard shortcuts.

## Current features:

- Function to enable mouse control via eye tracker (continuously move mouse to where you look at on the screen)

- Function to enable mouse control via eye tracker (stop updating mouse position)

- Function to put the mouse to the position on the screen that you are looking at once

- Function to put eye tracker to sleep

- Puts eye tracker to sleep automatically after 15 minutes

## Linux & Mac setup

Clone repo into `~/.talon/user`

```insert code:
cd ~/.talon/user
git clone git@github.com:epegzz/talon_config.git epegzz_talon
```
